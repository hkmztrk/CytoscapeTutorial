# Cytoscape Tutorial

## Tools

*  [Cytoscape](http://www.cytoscape.org) is an open source environment for the analysis and
integration of biological networks.
*  Cytoscape enables use of broad range of plugins targeting clustering, graph analysis,
ontology analysis and more. You can find the available plugins here,
[Cytoscape App Store](http://apps.cytoscape.org/) .
*  [Network Analyzer](http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/networkanalyzer) is a built-in plugin of Cytoscape, which provides statistical parameters of the network as well as central nodes.
*  [ClusterMaker2](http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/clustermaker2) provides a wide range of algorithms to find the densely connected clusters for the given network.
*  [MCODE](http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/mcode) is one of the specific methods to identify clusters.

## Data
### General Data
* [Example data sets](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/)
### Biological/Chemical Data
* [PDB](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/software/rest.do)
* [CHEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/)
*  [STRING](http://string-db.org) is a protein-protein interaction database which integrates both
known and predicted interactions.
*  [STITCH](http://stitch.embl.de/) provides three different interaction types to invesgate, chemical-chemical, protein-chemical and protein-protein. 
* [GLASS](http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/) is a GPCR-ligand interaction database.
* [DrugBank]()

## Understanding the Network

### Centrality
[Centrality](https://cs.hse.ru/data/2015/05/14/1098547089/4._Centrality_Metrics.pdf) metrics decide how important an actor in the network based on its position.
